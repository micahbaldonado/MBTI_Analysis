When the user was done with the main test, on the next page they answered a few questions about their own Myers-Briggs type (users who did not know their Myers-Briggs type were asked to skip this).
The following questions were asked on this page.

knowtype			"Do you already think you know what your Myers-Briggs personality type is?",  1=Yes,  2=No
knowntype			"What do you think your type is?"
confidenceintype	"How confident are you that this is your type?",  1=Not very confident,  2=Confident,  3=Very confident
prevhours			"Approximately how many hours in your life have you spent learning or thinking about the Myers-Briggs typology?"  1=0-1 hours,  2= 2-5 hours,  3=6-20 hours,  4=21 or more hours

Users were then asked if their answers were accurate and could be used for research, those who did not answer yes were discarded.
Users were then asked if they would be willing to complete an additional survey. Users who answered no went directly to their results and are not included in this dataset.

On the additional survey, the users were directed to open http://similarminds.com/jung.html in a different tab and to complete the test there. They were then asked to record their results and percentage results.

RIE		1=Introvert, 2=Extrovert
IEPERCENT	The percentage associated with their IE result
RSN		1=Sensing, 2=Intuition
SNPERCENT	The percentage associated with their SN result
RFT		1=Feeling, 2=Thinking
FTPERCENT	The percentage associated with their FT result
RJP		1=Judging, 2=Perceiving
JPPERCENT	The percentage associated with their JP result




SOME NOTES:

1. Percentage scores for complementary dichotomies add up to 100 in the SimilarMinds results. If %Introverted was 75, %extroverted was 25.

2. If the user recorded their data correctly, percentages should be between 50 and 100. Other percentages should be dropped from the dataset when analysing.

3. To get the underlying scale score, data will have to be transformed, for example:
		TRUE_IE_PERCENT =  { IEPERCENT 			RIE=1,
							 100-IEPERCENT		RIE=2
							}
4. The OEJTS 1.1 scale scores are computed thus:
		IE = (0 +  Q1)
		+ (6 -  Q5)
		+ (0 +  Q9)
		+ (6 -  Q13)
		+ (0 +  Q17)
		+ (6 -  Q21)
		+ (0 +  Q25)
		+ (6 -  Q29)
		+ (0 +  Q33)
		+ (6 -  Q37)
		+ (0 +  Q41)
		+ (6 -  Q45)
		SN = (0 +  Q2)
		+ (6 -  Q6)
		+ (0 +  Q10)
		+ (6 -  Q14)
		+ (0 +  Q18)
		+ (6 -  Q22)
		+ (0 +  Q26)
		+ (6 -  Q30)
		+ (0 +  Q34)
		+ (0 +  Q38)
		+ (0 +  Q42)
		+ (0 +  Q46)
		FT = (6 -  Q3)
		+ (0 +  Q7)
		+ (6 -  Q11)
		+ (0 +  Q15)
		+ (6 -  Q19)
		+ (0 +  Q23)
		+ (6 -  Q27)
		+ (0 +  Q31)
		+ (6 -  Q35)
		+ (0 +  Q39)
		+ (6 -  Q43)
		+ (0 +  Q47)
		JP = (0 +  Q4)
		+ (6 -  Q8)
		+ (0 +  Q12)
		+ (6 -  Q16)
		+ (0 +  Q20)
		+ (6 -  Q24)
		+ (0 +  Q28)
		+ (6 -  Q32)
		+ (0 +  Q36)
		+ (0 +  Q40)
		+ (0 +  Q44)
		+ (0 +  Q48)
		
5. The scoring for the OEJTS 1.1 has some problems (some items are poor quality), this is known.
